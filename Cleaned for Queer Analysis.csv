For example, the 1619 Project, whose basic tenets have been debunked by a broad range of scholars of history, was listed as recommended reading, in addition to many other such problematic resources.  
Also, last spring the Assistant Dean went out of her way to list over 50 attendees of an optional  diversity and inclusion workshop.  I, and several of my colleagues, saw this as a reverse ""name and shame"" attempt.  This was presented under the guise that this would enable the community to have a ""conversation"" with those ""leaders"" who chose to attend.  If this is such an effective method to spur conversations about Cockrell School Initiatives, then why have I not received lists of attendees at workshops that address other non-DEI workshops in Cockrell?

I suggest that the Assistant Dean's messages should be more carefully vetted by school leadership before they are released.  They are doing more harm than good."

I thought his answer was phenomenal because he said the responsibility lies in each of the faculty members to treat every single student as a unique individual. He gave some examples of how he tailored his mentoring and teaching styles for some of the minority students in his lab who have now gone on to successful careers. The staff member didn't think it was a good response so she kept pressing him on what he would do for Black students, specifically. He answered the first question well and didn't have much else to say. After, in reading comments from faculty and staff about this candidate, it became abundantly clear that just because he didn't say the ""right"" thing in response to this very odd question, he really lost favor with some faculty and especially the staff. I thought he was one of the best candidates. 

Inclusion and diversity goes both ways - it's possible to be politically conservative yet not a racist, shocking as it may seem. You can be conservative politically yet still care about the environment, gender equality, etc, but I hear so many negative things from my colleagues about conservative people that I choose to just not engage in any of these conversations, partly out of fear, but also because it honestly has no place in the workplace. We are here to do good engineering, teach our students, conduct innovative research. Yes, it's important to correct any systematic bias that disenfranchises specific student groups but we need to make sure that the standards apply across the board. I'd be curious how our conservative students are feeling about whether or not the school thinks they matter and are important too."

No time off and over work are the rule to some students. Not having clear rules of work demand can facilitate this.

Also, hidden rules that are not written are deceitful. Before enrolling in my program I was told by the Faculty that there was not a minimum number of classes to take. Once enrolled, I was told that although it is not written it was expected that I took 8 classes. Why is that not clear from the beginning? This did not happen only to me...

Finally, the worst professor (in the sense of teaching skills) I ever had was here. We provided honest feedback in the class evaluation survey. Then I learn that the awful teaching is not recent but from some decades ago. Is there any action taken to give feedback to the professor? it seems that not, maybe because she brings a lot of funding for research. Should it not be a balance between teaching skills and research? That was the only time that I felt I wasted time and money here and if possible I would have claimed back.

On the positive side, I also experienced a very committed and reachable Faculty here.

Being part of the Cockrell School it has also been difficult to feel like I fit in. There are a lot of people along the way that have been exceptionally kind and generous to help me feel so but the everyday overarching feeling that I have being part of this school even after four years, is that I don't fit in. One of the main reasons is due to the highly competitive environment , were it feels like if you don't know, you should not speak, were burnout is almost inevitable, and were students feel pressured to only study or work in things related to their major and STEM and having interests outside of the Cockrell School is not encouraged.

Lecturers can be another great way to diversify faculty. If the school takes the career support seriously (task force, meetings, mentoring, awards) then a pool of lecturers who find a career path could broaden and deepen the diversity within the school.

I think over the last year, with the pandemic, I do feel that the Cockrell School has not valued/recognized the extra effort this year has required for those of us with small children. This is related to being valued as a women in engineering, although I know my male colleagues have faced these challenges too.

Understandably, we did not receive a raise this year, but many of us have chosen to have in-home childcare due to the pandemic, which is more expensive than daycare. When childcare is not available, it is not easy to seek additional care since that requires breaking our quarantine bubble. With back-to-back Zoom meetings, it has been difficult to fit nursing/pumping into my schedule since I have a child under 1 year old, and I do not feel like I can openly talk about why I need to skip out of a meeting 20 minutes early sometimes. I feel that I have been asked to do the same amount of service as previous non-pandemic years, and need to fit that into the narrow hours I have childcare while still completing my research and teaching goals. This means almost nightly I am working until very late. I do not feel like anyone knows these struggles, since we only have perfunctory Zoom interactions. And, everyone is struggling so I feel like there is no where to go to get support, since the answer is ""everyone is struggling."""

My fear, as someone who is mixed-race, is that failure to consider these factors will end up mistreating minorities who happen to have a disproportionate amount of members who excel in one or more areas.

Speaking again as someone who is mixed-race, I have a strong preference for colorblindness and would much rather see this DEI stuff put aside.  Things were fine in the department.

As a rule I find all accepting, helpful, largely respectful, and that I am surrounded by opportunity. Daily demands can consume all time and I must advocate for my own professional growth. There is no specific time or support set aside for that aspect of work place life, but I have no overt expectation of such.
  
The University itself offers an abundance of opportunity, and I feel welcome to avail myself to it if circumstance makes it feasible - so the limiting factors appears to me to be time and personal motivation.

If there is any sense of disappointment or frustration, they are only those I share with others regarding common infrastructure issues (COVID-19 issues aside). 

1) transportation between Pickle and main campus: It is an unpredictable time sink. I fear UT is not engaged with the city sufficiently to maximize the opportunity of Project Connect. UT should be working very hard and very visibly to maximize its interests (and that of the city) to assure a robust Downtown/Main Campus - Domain/Pickle Research Campus transport corridor is created. Predictable, reasonably frequent, no transfers needed.

2) It feels like some important topics are ignored by the University, but this is much as in broader society. But if the University isn't a fountain of leadership and ideation on the tough topics, what venues are left?  For example, we have pockets of technical leadership in climate change science, but UT System management of PUF lands, our relationship with the O&G industrial interests, don't reflect world class effort nor intent to seize the leadership opportunity that one might hope for from self proclaimed energy university. Especially disappointing when the need is so great and the opportunity so large.

I remember we had a school kid group come over asking for charity and he was all enthusiastic, encouraged them, and gave them a dollar. The look on the kids face was of surprise and confusion. On the other hand, my grandfather thought giving a  5$ was being more than generous. (We had to laugh with the group  saying he was kidding and gave them a check for a much more appropriate amount). Why I say this is likely obvious. CSE leadership is in a tough position - trying to balance donor needs, broader culture, professional desires-  so even when they try to push for DEI reforms it is apparent it is highly watered down. The key seems to be what is the least that can be done so as to ensure we are not being blind to the DEI issues and that way we can still not be questioned by donors and prejudice. There is lot of lip service. There is good intent. Where is the actual implementation? Where is the bold leadership on this? The city went through a freeze and disaster. Other colleges, and deans and administrators went out of their way, connected with students, with faculty, with groups, as fellow humans, where were the CSE leaders? Sending a we are strong as a college, and we care message after the fact is iconic of checking the box, but not having it in the fiber that their role as leaders with empathy and service at heart.  Without strong leadership, without absolutely strong commitment to ensure diversity in all forms - race, culture,  expertise, ideas makes us stronger, this college of mine is going to be just this - a firm that educates students (thankful that it does well on technology and science), counts the $s, recruits people because of location and aura of the city as a blue dot in red sea, but essentially would never rise to the top unless it champions diversity. Respect every faculty no matter who they are. Treat them as equal, no matter what is their affiliation or expertise.  Create avenues for growth and recognition. Be leaders not managers. Without this we are all excelling our path to be firmly grounded as aspiring to be a topnotch but never a topnotch college for decade to come. I pray I am wrong."

Had I taken this survey as a sophomore, my answers may have been more negative leaning. Ultimately the Cockrell School of Engineering most certainly does promote the welfare and health of its students. During my 4 years here, I have encountered professors who were mean and left their students hanging, but I also have encountered professors who have helped me become the person I am today. 

For professor/ faculty evaluations, I'd say there should be a higher accountability for the eCIS surveys. Since eCIS surveys are given near the end of the semester, a lot of students tend to skip class to study for finals. Moreover, I think it might be helpful to have a survey after final exams as well- in my experience some professors can be unfair after final exams. As an example in my applied orbital class Spring 2020, my professor didn't adjust the assignment weights on Canvas after our transition to zoom. I thought I had an A in the class, but since the processor changed the grade weights in our course syllabus I actually had a B+. I don't really care too much about grades, but I felt wronged because our professor was not clear about changing the grade weights. However, by the time I had my final grade I had already submitted the eCIS survey. Moreover, expressing my disappointment would have required me to write a letter to the aerospace department's chair (per suggestion of UT Ombuds). I didn't feel comfortable writing the letter because I couldn't send the letter anonymously; moreover, I needed to remain on good terms with my applied orbital professor for future classes. 

That being said, I feel like there should be an accountability system for professors to be fair towards students after final exams. Otherwise, I absolutely love being the Cockrell community- it's definitely a place I call home."

There’s ECAC, but their material is outdated, and their help is often too general. The professional advice you give to a chemical engineer should not be the same as that of a software engineer. The interview process, work environment, skills required, are far too different. 

What’s worse, is that by having a poor professional support system, those without an alternative support system, are left behind. Guess what? Those students are typically first gens, who are typically minorities. I was raised to be very independent and taught to weight my priorities. I knew that preparing to ace an interview for an internship would have a far greater impact than preparing for an exam. I didn’t blow off my classes, but I knew when I could give trade off time and so I did. I am now blessed to have had 2 internships and a full time offer. Why do I say this? Because most of the people that look like me, already struggle enough in school to worry about an opportunity for the summer. Or they might worry, but the professional support WASNT THERE. They don’t have the parental mentorship that most students do because their parents probably didn’t even go to school, or they seek the advice of ECAC and it’s a total waste of their time. 

Anyways, I believe that professional development should be encouraged more and that the current professional system needs a massive restructure and update."

For example, I have a mac and no TA in my mechatronics or heat transfer lab has a mac and it's been a disaster getting everything to cooperate when I can't troubleshoot with these people. Eventually, for heat transfer, I got connected to a university computer technician and they worked through it with me, but in mechatronics, it's still ongoing. Since things have gone online it's much harder to be a personal advocate because I can't just walk into an office and stay there till something's situated.
I have had some professors seem like they care about my success before, but in such a big program you often do feel like a number in the system. The question regarding faculty, if that means like the dean and other higher-ups, I haven't had a personal relationship with any of them. Personally, I believe we could have had some in-person labs offered this semester, my fluids lab last semester was in person and I miss that, I wouldn't be dealing with these technological problems as well if I was in person. I have had personal advisors feel like they really helped me before and want me to succeed, but that was before COVID and I know most people who won't self-advocate by sitting in an office until an issue is resolved never experience that. @Kelly Frazer and Mckinlaye Harkavy, they've both really helped me on a personal level.
I said not applicable to the question about the culture of accepting people with different ideas because it is simply not something discussed. It is true that people have different ideas and I think that's beneficial, but people's beliefs are never discussed in engineering classes because no matter your beliefs there's only one right answer on a Statics/thermo/fluids/etc exam."

So in some ways I feel supported, however in some ways I feel my need for work life balance is not supported. I also feel that staff don't get enough recognition or support to do the work we do. Student services work can be a thankless job, so that becomes difficult in times of stress. All we want it to be seen, heard, and appreciated for the foundation we provide for student success. There are so many variables that impact student success it can be hard to acknowledge them all, however I feel it is administration's job as leaders to become aware and learn from past mistakes. Things could be worse, but they could be much improved as well. Transparency needs to be improved. Although money and faculty drive progress in Cockrell, they are not the only piece to the puzzle.

I believe this is because I am a woman, and there is an extremely disproportional gender ratio in my major (MechE). (I realize the university cannot totally control this ratio.) The men naturally tend to befriend each other and form groups while I feel awkward or intrusive or ""late to the party"" in a sense. Of course, it is very alienating to be a somewhat shy person starting a new life in a new city, but I feel I must go so extremely out of my way to find people who pay enough attention to include me or to see other women with similar interests that it's not sustainable. This has definitely impacted my school work because I tend to have trouble finding partners for projects, and I have few peers who happen to be in the same classes to turn to for questions or help. This is already a difficult major to pursue, and I just feel like I'm having to work harder than the men around me because I am at a disadvantage socially. Honestly, I don't have a great suggestion for fixing this problem because I've not really experienced blatant sexism or exclusion from staff/faculty/students. I'm starting to wonder if this major just isn't for me although I'm capable of learning it because I'm not sure if I would want to endure this in the actual work environment for the rest of my career."

(I was doing this because my team was trying to complete the project safely and mostly outdoors during the pandemic). The shop manager laughed at me (because the situation did look pretty silly because none of our electric saws were correctly size for the thickness of the wood), and he offered to help cut the post in the machine shop. Even though he was well intentioned, he assumed that I wasn't machine shop certified (even though every mechanical engineer undergrad has to be shop certified in their first year) and seemed surprised when I said I was a senior mech e. It was one of those situations that are pretty insignificant in the grand scheme of experiences as women in engineering, but it's an example that Cockrell and Walker's culture isn't completely where it should be yet.

I am being targeted as are many others.  I have worked at UT nearly 25 years and have been given several opportunities over the years (in the past) and thought I would eventually retire from UT because I love working here.  

But now everything has changed.   Last year I was asked to do extra work (way above my pay grade in responsibilities and with many extra hours expected causing me to lose a lot of vacation time).  Many people have been leaving CII, so I thought I was being given an opportunity to move up.  I was told that the extra work would lead to a promotion to be an Associate Director in 2021. Now that I put in all the time and effort (and made $500,000 in grants for CII)  he has decided that he wants to get rid of many more people, including me.  

He is deliberately doing things that is causing CII to fail. I and several other CII staff want to tell this story to someone.  It is a crisis!  We do not know who to turn to for help."

There is next to no support and the professors focus too much on how to get back to normal by overloading us with work.
